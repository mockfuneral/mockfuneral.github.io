title: About Mock Funeral
---

Mock Funeral is a site dedicated to older computer music software, primarily from the late 1990s to early 2000s, and anything tangentially related.

The page is, as of now, managed by me, mh.

I am in no way a computer or software expert. Only an enthusiastic user.

If you would like to contribute with a post about something relevant to the time period and/or site in general, please get in touch at

Same goes if you see something odd going on with the site.
Or if you would like to complain about how I don't understand anything.
