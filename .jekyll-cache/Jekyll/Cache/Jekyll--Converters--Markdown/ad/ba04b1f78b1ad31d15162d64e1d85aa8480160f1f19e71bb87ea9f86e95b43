<p>In October 2019 I found a link online to Bhob Rainey’s Xynthi Supercollider 2 patch, which I found out didn’t run on current day OSX/macOS operation systems. I listened to the three noisy samples in the recordings folder and decided I had to try this out somehow. So the following month I got a hold of of a Powerbook from 2002, installed OSX 10.3.9 on it alongside OS9.2.2 – just for the hell of it. Might as well go further back now that I have a machine that will allow that.</p>

<p>I got Xynthi working and loved it. Absolutely loved it. I used it quite regularly throughout 2020 and made a handful of releases using the patch. During all of this I had tried to get a few pieces of OS9 software to work, but with constant crashes and errors, so I put it away for a few months and focused on Xynthi.</p>

<p>In August 2020 I had to go to the Netherlands for 6-month exchange. Leaving all of my bulky gear in a basement in Copenhagen and only taking essentials, which, for some reason, also happened to include the Powerbook.</p>

<p>In November of 2020, a year after getting the Powerbook in the first place, I suddenly felt like it was time to revisit OS9 and old software in general. I made a thread on the lines forums (www.llllllll.com) to see if anyone had anything interesting to share. Software, stories, techniques, etc. Quite a lot of insightful replies later I decided to start this blog/site to archive the things people wrote. Mostly to have it be a bit more permanent than on a niche forum.</p>

<p>So here we are. A little blog to archive all these findings.</p>

<p>Why even care about, let alone USE, all this old software running on terribly obsolete hardware? I can’t give a really insightful, poetic answer. I just find it fascinating. And it sounds fantastic. Different.</p>

<p>I’ll do my best to keep this site alive. If you have any pieces of software you would like to write a bit about, experience using it, tips, techniques, stories, let me know.</p>

<p>All the best and take care.
