I"}<p>Mock Funeral is a site dedicated to older computer music software, primarily from the late 1990s to early 2000s.</p>

<p>The page is managed by me, mh.</p>

<p>I am in no way a computer or software expert. Only an enthusiastic user.</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute with a post about something relevant to the time period and/or site in general, please get in touch at</p>

<p>www [dot] mockfuneralmh [at] gmail [dot] com</p>

<p>Same goes if you see something odd going on with the site. Or if you would just like to complain about how I donâ€™t understand anything.</p>
