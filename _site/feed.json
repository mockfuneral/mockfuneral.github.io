            "content_text": "Written by mh.Xynthi is a Supercollider patch made by Bhob Rainey, released as a stand-alone executable in 2006.The patch is made to (visually at least) emulate the EMS Synthi series of synthesizers from the early 70s, but it’s not aimed to be a sonically faithful recreation of it. Which would probably be quite the fruitless task. Though the pin matrix works much the same as on the Synthi.This patch is the entire reason I got an old 2002 Powerbook to begin with. I wrote about it in the introduction post.I’m struggling to find the fitting words. I don’t want to over-exaggerate, but I really do love this patch. I’ve gotten so much useful material out of it and it’s pretty fun to explore. It can create grating digital textures, bleeps, bloops and lovingly soft and hellishly harsh drones. In the audio section further down I’ve added some of my work using the patch.From the included README:  Xynthi is a universal build, so you’ll need 10.3.9 or higher to run it.  you’ll know it’s working if you can open it, load an included preset, and hear something crazy coming through your speakers.For me, it didn’t work under macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra), but I’ve heard of another slightly different version that somehow did run on that OS. I can’t say for sure. I will update if I find out.I wrote an email to Rainey to ask him for a link I could share for this blog (see the links section) and to ask for a Paypal address, should people want to donate to him. He sent me back a nice email explaining why it never got beyond its current state, which I am putting here with permission from Rainey himself.  I believe that the only reason it doesn’t work in the current macOS is the switch to only accept 64-bit apps. It may be possible to do a 64-bit build and have it work. What I’d really like to do is just host the code on GitHub, so that anyone who has a working version of SuperCollider could use the app. That’s a medium-sized project, since SC switched to .scd files instead of .rtf, many of the GUI elements have changed, and the fact that you can’t define classes on-the-fly in SC means that some custom classes would have to be converted to class-like structures like Events. A mildly nauseating set of tasks that I just haven’t had the time and stomach to get to.I do have PayPal at this address (lloydlyson@gmail.com). I think that, in the entire time since Xynthi was released, which is at least 12 years, one person has sent me a payment of around $10. Never make your target audience a bunch of experimental noise dudes if you want to make a buck :)A lighthearted end. I trust there must be some experimental noise dudes reading this. I sent him some bucks after the email, since I’ve used Xynthi a whole lot more than some of my paid applications and pieces of software.Forever evaluating.LinksDownload XynthiBhob Rainey’s websiteAudio“ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE” (2019).ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE by Marc Hasselbalch“Strong Whip (Versatile)” (2020).Strong Whip (Versatile) by Marc Hasselbalch“Brushed Steel Minesweeper” (2020).Brushed Steel Minesweeper by Marc Hasselbalch“April 3” (2020)Lockdown (March 13–April 14) by Marc Hasselbalch“March 14” (2020)Lockdown (March 13–April 14) by Marc HasselbalchScreenshotsBlank patchNoisy, scratchy patchXynthi running on OSX 10.3.9 on a titanium Powerbook G4 from 2002.",

It is the commercial upgrade to his earlier free software, SoundEffects, from a few years prior.I have tried to get in contact with Ricci since I started using the software, but no luck so far. I found an email address on his old 2003 website, but, unsurprisingly, it didn’t go through. It seems he might work at Apple these days.SoundMagicFX by Michael Norris is a suite of plugins for SoundMaker. The plugins are still available for download at Michael Norris’ website, but the shareware plugins folder requires a password and, when imported into SoundMaker, requires a registration code to use them.Upon realizing this, I contacted Michael Norris and asked if I could obtain a license. He got back to me, but unfortunately he didn’t remember the password after all these years. Further research into the plugins led me to an interview with Markus Popp/Oval, who apparently was using SoundMaker and the Norris plugins in the late 90s. So I contacted him and asked if he had them somewhere on an old machine. Not more than a day later he got back to me with the passwords.I have received permission from Michael Norris himself to share the password for the shareware folder and registration code here.

But I really am liking this very different way of working. Load up a file, load up a process, adjust, wait for 10-60 seconds, result. Listen, adjust, process, result. Because of the limited memory of my Powerbook, I can’t really go nuts with the processes, as it will quickly run out of memory and tell me so right away. So I find myself working with quite short audiofiles, which I then process and save different versions of for later use. So I end up having this little sound bank after each SoundMaker session that I can then arrange, re-sample, whatever, on my modern laptop (which, as of this post, is from 2012). I really don’t mind the DAW puzzle micro-arrangement workflow, since it really forces me to work with and perceive time on a wholly different scale. I wonder if this will push me to compose very short pieces. Micro works.

It doesn’t even feature an ‘undo’ function. I tried to import the SoundMagicFX plugins into SoundEffects, but they don’t show up. In case you wanted to try it out.

I tried to process a file that was a bit long and very quickly during the process rendering, it ran out of memory and cancelled the operation. Sometimes when SoundMaker does this, it will still have rendered some of the file. Sometimes when it does this, it just glitches out completely for some of the file. Absolutely lovely sounds. After this I ran the same process again and it glitched out again, but when I went to save the file, the glitching had disappeared from the file. It didn’t even appear in the waveform anymore. It was only there for a brief moment.

I tried to process a file that was a bit long and very quickly during the process rendering, it ran out of memory and cancelled the operation. Sometimes when SoundMaker does this, it will still have rendered some of the file. Sometimes when it does this, it just glitches out completely for some of the file. Absolutely lovely sounds. After this I ran the same process again and it glitched out again, but when I went to save the file, the glitching had disappeared from the file. It didn’t even appear in the waveform anymore. It was only there for a brief moment. I still haven’t been able to recreate this.</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/944144839&amp;color=%236c6c6a&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mockfuneral\" title=\"Mock Funeral Audio\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Mock Funeral Audio</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mockfuneral/soundmaker-soundmagicfx-memory\" title=\"SoundMaker &amp; SoundMagicFX: Memory glitch\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">SoundMaker &amp; SoundMagicFX: Memory glitch</a></div><p>Here some of the manipulated files from SoundMaker are mangled by a a ppooll patch on a modern laptop.

I listened to the three noisy samples in the recordings folder and decided I had to try this out somehow. So the following month I got a hold of of a Powerbook from 2002, installed OSX 10.3.9 on it alongside OS9.2.2 – just for the hell of it. Might as well go further back now that I have a machine that will allow that.I got Xynthi working and loved it. Absolutely loved it. I used it quite regularly throughout 2020 and made a handful of releases using the patch. During all of this I had tried to get a few pieces of OS9 software to work, but with constant crashes and errors, so I put it away for a few months and focused on Xynthi.In summer of 2020 I had to go to the Netherlands for a 6-month exchange. Leaving all of my bulky gear in a basement in Copenhagen and only taking essentials, which, for some reason, also happened to include the Powerbook.In November of 2020, a year after getting the Powerbook in the first place, I suddenly felt like it was time to revisit OS9 and old software in general. I made a thread on the lines forums to see if anyone had anything interesting to share. Software, stories, techniques, etc. Quite a lot of insightful replies later I decided to start this blog/site to archive the things people wrote. Mostly to have it be a bit more permanent than on a niche forum.So here we are. A little blog to archive all these findings.Why even care about, let alone USE, all this old software running on terribly obsolete hardware? I can’t give a really insightful, poetic answer. I just find it fascinating. And it sounds fantastic. Different.I’ll do my best to keep this site alive. If you have any pieces of software you would like to write a bit about, experience using it, tips, techniques, stories, let me know.Contact me atmockfuneralmh [at] gmail [dot] comor over at Twitter, @mockfuneralAll the best and take care.mh",
